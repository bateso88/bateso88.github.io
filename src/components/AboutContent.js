              <p>I am junior developer focussing on the back-end who has 
                recently graduated from Makers Academy. I found the three months
                 there challenging, exciting and immensely rewarding. I am now 
                 looking for a role that allows me to further expand my learning
                  through complex problem-solving and continued exposure to new 
                  technologies.</p>

                Previously I worked in insurance, in the Lloyd's of London 
                market for 4 years. Automation was an essential skill I taught 
                myself in order to improve accuracies in large amounts of data 
                and save time otherwise spent on needless manual tasks. The 
                satisfaction of seeing the vast improvements that my influence 
                had on my team's work led me to consider a career change.

                I investigated the growing Insurtech industry and attended 
                several conferences and lectures. I came to the conclusion that 
                I would like to be a part of the tech industry to help modernise,
                 disrupt and improve other industries. The enjoyment I had at Makers
                  has now cemented in my mind the fact that I have made the right 
                decision.

                I recently bought and converted a Ford Transit and did a European 
                road trip in 2020, for as long as the situation permitted. I now 
                plan to take it on weekends away as much as possible!
